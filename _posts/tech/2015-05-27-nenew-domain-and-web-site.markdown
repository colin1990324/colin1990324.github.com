After the expiration of ruiwu.me, I'm looking for a new cheap solution for my personal blog. The original AWS EC2 & Wordpress solution is a little bit expensive for individuals and I know one of my friend [Zhaoyu](http://hackecho.com/) is using a Github & Jekyll solution. Since all those services are free and I bought the new domain wurui.cc for 7 years at the price 318 rmb, this solution should be easy and reasonable.

So you can find lots of instructions for set up a blog on github.
Here gives the outline and some links I used.

### Set up Github

If you don't have a github account. [Click](https://github.com/join) to register.
